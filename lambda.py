# A lambda function is a small anonymous function defined using the lambda keyword.
# It can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression (no multiple lines).

# print((lambda l: [x**3 for x in l])([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))



# cube_by_list = lambda l: [n * n * n for n in l]

# l = [i for i in range(1,10)]

# print(cube_by_list(l))

l = [i for i in range(1,101)]
print(l)
